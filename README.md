# Password Brute Force Time Estimator

## Description
This project is a simple simulator that estimates the time required to brute-force a password using different character combinations. The program calculates how long it would take to guess a password based on its length and the character set used.

## Features
- **Brute-force time estimation**: Calculates the time needed to try all possible combinations for a password.
- **Flexible character sets**: Supports combinations of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols.
- **Customizable brute-force speed**: Allows you to set a realistic guessing speed (guesses per second).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamzah82/BruteforceCalc.git
cd BruteforceCalc
```

2. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Enter the password you want to estimate the brute-force time for.

## How It Works
1. The program will prompt the user to input a password.
2. It will then calculate the number of combinations required to brute-force the password.
3. The estimated brute-force time will be displayed based on the guessing speed and the length of the password.

## Example Output

```
Enter password: abcd1234
Estimated brute force time: 1.20 days
```
